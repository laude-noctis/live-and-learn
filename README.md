# live-and-learn

## Description

This code contain the making of webpage for Horiseon Social Services. https://lizziebumpers.github.io/live-and-learn/

This webpage is designed to help understand how the internet and business growth can be used together.

I contributed by making the HTML code more organzied and in a semantic order and added "alt" descriptions for the images. 

I, then, went into style.css and reattched the styling with the new semantic order and consolidated the css styling coding.
